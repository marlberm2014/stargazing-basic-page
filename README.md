# Stargazing Basic Page

This is a basic HTML, CSS and JS code for a background with animation for stargazing. The CSS is compiled using SASS.
This project is based on [https://codepen.io/marlberm2014/pen/oVgVzm](https://codepen.io/marlberm2014/pen/oVgVzm) which was forked from [https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun](https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun) and [https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/Jdwug](https://codepen.io/loktar00/pen/Jdwug)

Currently the height and width of various components are hardcoded, can be further improve so that the logic can take any screen size.
